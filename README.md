# Data Strcutures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository is a bundle of code written in python programming language for implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. I have honed my understanding of these concepts so that I would be glad to share this repository. This bundle was witnessing my learning journey in the course Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises as taught by Scott Barrett on Udemy.

## What's Inside?
1. **Data Structures**
  Efficiently implemented examples of essential data structures, including:
  Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Tree, Hash Table, Graph and Heap
3. **Algorithms**
  Step-by-step implementations of algorithms across different categories, such as:
  Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
  Searching Algorithms: Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS).
  Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci Sequence.

## Features
- **Readable Code**: Simple, well-documented code for easy understanding.
- **Modular Structure** : Organized by topic for ease of navigation.
